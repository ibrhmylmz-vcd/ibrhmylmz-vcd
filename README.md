# Hi I'm Ibrahim Yilmaz 

## Who am I
***
- I'm studens at Visual Communication Design
- I'm trying to be a front-end developer


I want to specialize in UI/UX design and combine that with front-end skills. We are going to a future where user experience matters so I think my UX and UI knowledge will help me in developing software. That's why I'm studying visual communication design.


- I am dealing with 3d design as an amateur in my spare time. You can check it out from the link below.â˜Ÿ
